\section{Introduction}
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressed rapidly from early symbolic systems to modern deep learning and large language models. Foundational algorithms such as the perceptron~\citep{rosenblatt1958perceptron} and backpropagation~\citep{rumelhart1986learning} paved the way for convolutional networks~\citep{lecun1998gradient,krizhevsky2012imagenet} and attention-based architectures~\citep{vaswani2017attention,devlin2018bert,brown2020language}.

This sample paper demonstrates a minimal LaTeX setup using Bib\TeX{} for citations, section includes, and typical assets like figures and tables. It is intentionally small so you can adapt it quickly for your own AI projects.
